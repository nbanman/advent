# advent

This is a 12/1/2023 fork of [Ross MacArthur's Advent of Code run environment](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/advent/).
He shared his runner but I'm new to Rust and had
trouble extricating the library tool. So I just cloned the entire repo and will be using it as the
basis for my solutions. All solutions prior to 2023 are his, maybe I will delete them or do
something with them later.

Below is his readme as of 12/1/2023. Thanks, Ross!

My ðŸŽ… [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. Includes a runner
and benchmarker with free Christmas trees ðŸŽ„.

## Getting started

The `cargo advent` tool will automatically fetch the input for the puzzle when
it is required. This requires the `ADVENT_SESSION` environment variable to be
set. You can find this under the cookie name "session" in your logged in Advent
of Code browser session.

```sh
export ADVENT_SESSION="533..."
```

To run a specific solution just use the provided `cargo advent` alias and pass
in the year and day. For example, the following will run the solution for 2020
day 18.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 run
```

Tests can be run using the `test` subcommand.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 test
```

Benchmarks can be run using the  `bench` subcommand.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 bench
```

Extra arguments can be passed to both Cargo and the binary. Arguments after the
first `--` argument will be passed to Cargo and arguments after the second `--`
will be passed to the actual binary. For example if we wanted the JSON output of
the benchmark we could run the following.

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 18 bench -- --features=json -- --output json
```

All of the above will be built using `--release`.

### New solutions

Use the following to add a [template](./crates/cli/src/template.rs) for a new
solution.

```
cargo advent -y 2022 -d 1 new
```

Open the browser for the given problem

```
cargo advent -y 2020 -d 7 open
```

The input will be downloaded the first time the solution is run.

## Using the runner/benchmarker

You can use the provided runner and benchmarker for your own solutions. To get
started simply add the crate to the Cargo manifest for your solution.

```toml
[dependencies]
advent = { git = "https://github.com/rossmacarthur/advent" }
```

Then use the following as your main function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let solution = advent::new(parse_input).part(part1).part(part2).build();
    solution.cli()
}
```

**Where**

- `parse_input` is a function that returns any type `I` implementing `Clone`.
- Each part function takes `I` as an argument and returns something implementing
  `Display`.

Finally, `cli()` will instantiate a command line interface and run the program.
Ordinary runs will run each part once and output the answers. Passing `--bench`
to the program will perform a benchmark.

That's all! You're free to structure your program however else you want. See
[template.rs](./crates/cli/src/template.rs) for the template I use or any of the
solutions in this crate for an example.

### Features

There are also some optional features which pull in some other crates.

- **`festive`** enables some festive ascii art and changes the default output to
  `--output festive`
- **`json`** supports JSON output using `--output json`, useful for collecting
  benchmark information
- **`prelude`** re-exports my prelude crate that can be imported using
  ```rust
  use advent::prelude::*;
  ```

They can be enabled in your Cargo manifest like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
advent = { git = "https://github.com/rossmacarthur/advent", features = ["festive", "json"] }
```
